# GrayWhale_Model
In this repository you will find the Vensim PLE model we developed to identify the critical ecological threshold and 
to ascertain the carrying capacity of whale watching boats in Ojo de Liebre lagoon, México.

We conceptualized the carrying capacity as associated to the critical ecological threshold of low resilience for the whale population. Thus, to identify the threshold we combined system dynamics modeling, to simulate the boats’ impact on the breeding habitat with ecological risk assessment, to determine the probability of crossing a critical ecological threshold.
