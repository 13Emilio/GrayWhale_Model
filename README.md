# GrayWhale_Model
In this repository you will find the Vensim PLE model we developed to identify the critical ecological threshold and 
to ascertain the carrying capacity of whale watching boats in Ojo de Liebre lagoon, México.

We conceptualized the carrying capacity as the critical ecological threshold indicating a potential transition to a low resilience 
state of the gray whale breeding population. Thus, to identify the threshold we combined system dynamics modeling, to simulate the
boats’ impact on the breeding habitat.
